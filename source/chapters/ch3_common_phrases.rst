Common Phrases
==============
In this chapter common phrases like what my name is or I like something, are explained/listed.

To Like & Not Like
------------------
The following words are used:

================= ===========
suki              like/love
suki janai        not like/not love
daisuki           really like
kirai             hate
jozu              good at
heta              bad at
================= ===========

The structure of a sentence is as following:

| 1. <subject> wa <noun> ga suki desu
| 2. <noun> ga suki desu
| 3. <noun> ga suki janai desu
| 4. <subject> wa <noun> ga suki janai desu

The sentence 1. says that the <subject> likes the <noun>, where in sentence 2.
the subject is implicit and can change depending on the context. But mostly it means I like <noun>.

The ga specifies that the <noun> is the thing you love
"suki" can be exchanged with daisuki, to say that you really really like something

If you want to say, that you (or somebody else) doesn't like a thing, than "suki" can be changed to 
"suki janai" like in 3. This than means, that you don't like something. 
To say that you don't just not like it, but you hate it, you can use kirai, instead of "suki"

As with all sentence in Japanese, if you want to ask a question then just add a "ka" at the end.
The last example was translated to you instead of I. This is because you probably want to ask somebody.
But if your in a discussion and taking about somebody else then the question would probably ask about him.

Examples
________

| Neko ga suki desu = (I) like cats.
| Watashi wa neko ga suki desu = I like cats
| Sakā ga suki desu = (I) like soccer
| Onisan wa neko ga suki desu = (My) brother likes soccer 
| Kōhī ga suki janai desu. = (I) don't like coffee.
| Onisan wa Kōhī ga suki janai desu. = (My) brother doesn't like coffee.
| Onisan wa Kōhī ga kirai desu. = (My) brother hates coffee.
| Sushi ga suki desu ka? = Do (you) like sushi?


Describing Something
--------------------
The structure for describing something in Japansee is:

| <noun> wa <adjective>.
| <noun> ga <adjective>.

Here are some examples:
| Yamada-san ga yasashii desu. = Yamanda is kind
| Yamada-san wa omoshiroi desu. = Yamada is funny

(For the diffrence between wa and ga read the chapter :ref:`Wa vs Ga <wa-vs-ga>`)

Where are you formal
--------------------

| Amerika kara kimashita. = (I am) from America.
| <place> kara kimashita. = (I am) from <place>.
| Amerika kara kimashita ka? = (Are you) from America?
| Doko kara kimashita ka? = Where (are you) from?

``kara`` from "kara kimashita" is a particle and means ``from``. ``kimashita`` is the verb "to come"
in the past tense. Together they mean "came from".
By adding the ``ka`` at the end, you make it a question.
And finally the ``doko`` means where.

The (I am) are in parenthesises because they are inferred from the context of the conversation.
