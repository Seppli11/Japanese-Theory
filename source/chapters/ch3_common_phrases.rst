Common Phrases
==============
In this chapter common phrases like what my name is or I like something, are explained/listed.

To Like & Not Like
------------------
The following words are used:

================= ===========
suki              like/love
suki janai        not like/not love
daisuki           really like
kirai             hate
jozu              good at
heta              bad at
================= ===========

The structure of a sentence is as following:

| 1. <subject> wa <noun> ga suki desu
| 2. <noun> ga suki desu
| 3. <noun> ga suki janai desu
| 4. <subject> wa <noun> ga suki janai desu

The sentence 1. says that the <subject> likes the <noun>, where in sentence 2.
the subject is implicit and can change depending on the context. But mostly it means I like <noun>.

The ga specifies that the <noun> is the thing you love
"suki" can be exchanged with daisuki, to say that you really really like something

If you want to say, that you (or somebody else) doesn't like a thing, than "suki" can be changed to 
"suki janai" like in 3. This than means, that you don't like something. 
To say that you don't just not like it, but you hate it, you can use kirai, instead of "suki"

As with all sentence in Japanese, if you want to ask a question then just add a "ka" at the end.
The last example was translated to you instead of I. This is because you probably want to ask somebody.
But if your in a discussion and taking about somebody else then the question would probably ask about him.
