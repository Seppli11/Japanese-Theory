Sentence Structure
==================
In this chapter the structure of Japanese sentence is explained

General Structure
-----------------
The general structure of a sentence in Japanese is: ``<subject> <object> <verb>``
To show which part of a sentence is what subject and objects are usually marked with particles
like wa, ga, or, etc.


.. _wa-vs-ga:

Wa vs Ga
--------
Wa and ga can sometimes be used interchangeably. As a rule of thumb:
``Ga is for new or unkown topics and wa is for already introduced topics``

As en example:

| Yamada-san ga yasashii desu. = Yamanda is kind
| Yamada-san wa omoshiroi desu. = Yamada is funny

In the first sentence we use ga because there is a new topic, Yamada-san. 
In the second sentence we're already talking about Yamada-san and thus we use wa.

Wa and ga can also be used to emphasize part of the sentence. In English,
we usually do this by raising our voice.

| 1. Sushi wa oishii desu. = Sushi is **delicious**.
| 2. Sushi ga oishii desu. = **Sushi** is delicious. 

In the first sentence the "delicious" part is important while in the second sentence
the emphasizes is on sushi. 

O Particle
----------
The ``o`` particle has several uses and the following list isn't complete.

Object Particle
_______________
The ``o`` particle can be used to mark the object. 
Example:

| Ringo o tabemasu. = (I) eat an apple.
| Orenji-jusu o nomimasu = (I) drink orange juice

Where You Leave
_______________
The ``o`` particle can also be used to show where you leave or depart from.
Here are a  few examples:

| Ie o demasu. = (I will) leave the house.
| Baseu o orimasu. = (I will) get off the bus.
| Shigoto o yasumimasen. = (I will) not have a break from work.
