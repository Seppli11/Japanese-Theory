Sentence Structure
==================
In this chapter the structure of Japanese sentence is explained

General Structure
-----------------
The general structure of a sentence in Japanese is: ``<subject> <object> <verb>``
To show which part of a sentence is what subject and objects are usually marked with particles
like wa, ga, or, etc.

No Particle
-----------
``no`` is the genitive particle and can combine multiple nouns. It is used like ``N1 no N2``. N2 belongs to N1.

| watashi no kodomo = my child
| IMC no kaishan = IMC employee


.. _wa-vs-ga:

Wa vs Ga
--------
Wa and ga can sometimes be used interchangeably. As a rule of thumb:
``Ga is for new or unkown topics and wa is for already introduced topics``

As en example:

| Yamada-san ga yasashii desu. = Yamanda is kind
| Yamada-san wa omoshiroi desu. = Yamada is funny

In the first sentence we use ga because there is a new topic, Yamada-san. 
In the second sentence we're already talking about Yamada-san and thus we use wa.

Wa and ga can also be used to emphasize part of the sentence. In English,
we usually do this by raising our voice.

| 1. Sushi wa oishii desu. = Sushi is **delicious**.
| 2. Sushi ga oishii desu. = **Sushi** is delicious. 

In the first sentence the "delicious" part is important while in the second sentence
the emphasizes is on sushi.
Ga as But
_________
``ga`` if used in the middle of a sentence, means "but" or "however".

| Sushi wa tabemasu ga, sakana wa tabemasen. = (I will) eat sushi, but (I will) no eat fish.

Wa to constrast
_______________
``wa`` can be used to highlith the difference between to objects or subjects. It will replace ``o`` or ``ga``.
This can be useful in sentence where two things are compared like with "but" or "however" 
(see :ref:`But (or) However<but-or-however>` for "but" and "however" sentences)

| Kocha wa nomimasu. Demo, kohi wa nomimasen = (I) drink tea. However, (I) don't drink coffee.

Mo
__
``mo`` means *also/as well* and replaces the ``wa`` particle

| Santou-san *mo* kaishan desu = Santou-san is also an employee.

O Particle
----------
The ``o`` particle has several uses and the following list isn't complete.

Object Particle
_______________
The ``o`` particle can be used to mark the object. 
Example:

| Ringo o tabemasu. = (I) eat an apple.
| Orenji-jusu o nomimasu = (I) drink orange juice

Where You Leave
_______________
The ``o`` particle can also be used to show where you leave or depart from.
Here are a  few examples:

| Ie o demasu. = (I will) leave the house.
| Baseu o orimasu. = (I will) get off the bus.
| Shigoto o yasumimasen. = (I will) not have a break from work.

Ni Particle
-----------
``ni`` is known as the location particle and can be loosely translated to "in", "on", "at" or "to" depending
on the usage. It's important to remember that its usage isn't always the same as in english.

``ni`` is often used together with a verb of motion, like "come", "go" or "walk" in a structure like
``<noun> ni <verb of motion>``

Show a destination
__________________
``ni`` can be used to show a destination.

| Eki ni ikimasu. = (I will) go to the train station.
| Densha ni norimasu. = (I will) ride the train.
| Hon op kaban ni iremasu. = (I will) put the book in (my) bag.

A Point of Contatct
___________________
With ``ni`` you can also show a point of contact with an other person.

| Tomodachi ni denwa shimasu. = (I) will call (my) friend.
| Raishu kazoku ni aimasu. = (I will) meet (my) famaly next week.

Mark the Time
_____________
You can also mark the time in a sentence, as long it isn't a relative time pronoun, like "now" or "tomorrow".

| Shichi-ji ni ikimasu = (I will) go at seven o'clock

.. _mark-a-place:
Mark a Place
____________
If ``ni`` is placed at the start of a sentence, it indicates a location where the action takes place.
``ni`` can also be placed in the middle. This changes the focus of the sentence as seen in the following example.

| **Asoko ni** inu ga imasu. = There is a dog **over there**.
| Inu wa **Asoko ni** imasu. = The dog is **over there**.
| **Eki ni** keisatsukan ga imasu. = There is a policeman **at the train station**.

To and Ya
---------
In Japanese you use ``to`` and ``ya`` to say "and".

``to`` acts like the english counterpart "and" and connects to nouns, like so:

| ringo to orenji = apples and oranges
| ino to neko = dogs and cats
| Keki to kukki to aisu o tabemsu. = (I will) eat cake, cookies and ice cream.

.. Note:: ``to`` can also be used to mean "width" or "to" when it connects a noun to a verb, as the following example shows:

    | Tomodachi to asobimasu. = (I will) hang out with (my) friend.
    | Okasan to otosan to onesan to bangohan o tabemasu. = (I) eat dinner with (my) mom, dad and older sister.

``ya`` is called the "listing particle" and is used to show that the list isn't complete. It can be compared to "etc." 
in English. Here are some examples:

| Chokoreto ya keki ga suki desu. = (I) like chocolate and cake (and some other things).
| Yasai ya sakana o kaimasu. = (I will) buy vegetables and fish (ands some other things).

.. Note:: You can't mix ``yo`` and ``to`` in the same list

Also Mo
-------
The word ``mo`` can be translated to "also" or "too" and it replaces the ``wa``, ``ga`` and ``o`` in a sentence.

| Watashi mo suki desu! = I like (it) too! (wa was replaced by mo)
| Yakyu ga suki desu. Sakka mo suki desu = (I) like baseball. (I) also like soccer. 

To make everythingh a bit more complicated: If ``mo`` is used multiple times in a sentence, it also means "and".
But ``mo`` is used after every object/noun in the list.

| Niku mo yasai mo oishi desu = Meat and vegetables are (both) delicious.
| Watashi wa ryori mo e mo jozu desu. = I am good at (both) cooking and drawing.

.. _but-or-however:

But (or) However
----------------
"but" and "however" have multiple words in Japanese.

.. Note:: ga can also be used to say "but" or "however" this however is described in :ref:`Wa vs Ga<wa-vs-ga>`

Demo
____
``demo`` is used at the start of a sentence. If you want to be polite, you can use ``shikashi`` instead.
This however is mostly used in writting or formal speeches.

| Nihongo wa tanoshi desu. Demo, muzukashi desu. = Japanese is fun. However, (it) is difficult.
| Nihongo wa tanoshi desu. Shikashi, muzukashi desu. = Japanese is fun. However, (it) is difficult.

Kedo
____
``kedo`` can also join two sentences but compared to ``demo``, it is in the middle of the final sentence.
Like with ``demo`` and ``shikashi``, there is also a polite version of ``kedo``: ``keredo``. It is 
also mostly used in formal speech or writing.

| Sushi wa tabemasu kedo, sakana wa tabemasen. = (I will) eat sushi but (I will) not eat fish.
| Inaka wa shizuka desu kedo, fuben desu. = The countryside is quiet but (it) is inconvenient.
| Inaka wa shizuka desu keredo, fuben desu. = The countryside is quiet but (it) is inconvenient. (formal)
