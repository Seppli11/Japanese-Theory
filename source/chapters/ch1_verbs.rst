Verbs
=====
In Japanese verbs can be conjugated like in English. But there are only two tenses: the past 
and the non-past tense, which is used for both present and future sentences.

Unlike the English verbs, Japanse verbs also include the "politeness-level".

The endings are appended after the stem form of a verb.

Present-Polite
--------------
To say something in the present in a polite way, ``-masu`` is appended to the stem form.
If the meaning should be negated then ``-masen`` is appended, which translates to "not <verb>"
Here are some Examples:

========= =============== =============== ===========
Stem-Form positive        negative        Translation
========= =============== =============== ===========
iki       ikimasu         ikimasen        gehen
tabe      tabemasu        tabemasen       essen
shi       shimasu         shimasen        do / play
========= =============== =============== ===========


Shimasu-Verbs
-------------
With the "verb" ``shimasu`` you can turn a noun into a verb.

| benkyo = study
| benkyo shimasu = to study
| renshu = practice
| renshu shimasu = to practice
| ryori = cooking
| ryori shimasu = to cook

This can't be done with every noun. Here is an (incomplete) list:

+ benkyo = study
+ ryoko = vacation / trip / travel
+ denwa = phone / call
+ renshu = practice
+ ryori = cooking / cuisine

Imasu vs Arimasu (To Be, To Have, etc)
--------------------------------------
Both ``imasu`` and ``arimasu`` can be used to say that something exits or something
will happen. The difference is that imasu is used with animate object while arimasu with
inanimate object.

As a general rule: If it can move on its own, use ``imasu`` else ``ariamsu``.

| Asoko ni Neko ga imasu. = There is a cat over there (animate).
| Neko **wa** asoko ni imasu. = The cat is over there.
| Konbini ga arimasu. = There is a convenience store (inanimate).
| Terebi ga arimasu. = (I) have a TV. / There is a TV.
| Imoto ga imasu. = (I) have a younger sister. / There is a younger sister. (makes less sense)
| Ashita tesuto ga arimasu. = There (will) be a test tomorrow.

Depending on the context ``imasu`` and ``arimasu`` can say what you own/have, a "There is x" sentence
or that something will happen in the future.

Additionaly a place can be specified by placing ``<place> ni`` in the sentence.
