Verbs
=====
In Japanese verbs can be conjugated like in English. But there are only two tenses: the past 
and the non-past tense, which is used for both present and future sentences.

Unlike the English verbs, Japanse verbs also include the "politeness-level".

The endings are appended after the stem form of a verb.

Present-Polite
--------------
To say something in the present in a polite way, ``-masu`` is appended to the stem form.
If the meaning should be negated then ``-masen`` is appended, which translates to "not <verb>"
Here are some Examples:
