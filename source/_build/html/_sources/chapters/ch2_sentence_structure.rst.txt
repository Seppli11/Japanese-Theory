Sentence Structure
==================
In this chapter the structure of Japanese sentence is explained

Describing Something
--------------------
The structure for describing something in Japansee is:

| <noun> wa <adjective>.
| <noun> ga <adjective>.

(For the diffrence between wa and ga read the next chapter)

.. _wa_vs_ga:
wa vs ga
--------
Wa and ga can sometimes be used interchangable. As a rule of thumb:
``Ga is for new or unkown topics and wa is for already introduced topics``

As en example:

| Yamada-san ga yasashii desu. = Yamanda is kind
| Yamada-san wa omoshiroi desu. = Yamada is funny

In the first sentence we use ga because there is a new topic, Yamada-san. 
In the second sentence we're already talking about Yamada-san and thus we use wa.

Wa and ga can also be used to emphasize part of the sentence. In English
we usualy do this by rasing our voice.

| 1. Sushi wa oishii desu. = Sushi is **delicious**.
| 2. Sushi ga oishii desu. = **Sushi** is delicious. 

In the first sentence the "delicious" part is importent while in the second sentence
the emphasizis is on sushi.
